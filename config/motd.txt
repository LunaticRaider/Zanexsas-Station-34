Rules :
0. This is a LRP/NRP server. RP is not required at all, since most of the game is about working and doing your stuff, stories aren't really required. You're allowed to talk about anything in IC/OOC.
1. No ERP/NSFW content in any type of chat.
2. The only crime here is not being funny. We all deserve a good laugh sometimes!
3. If you get banned, you've really annoyed us and don't expect to get unbanned.
