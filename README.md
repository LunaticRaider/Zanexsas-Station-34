# Dabber Station 13 - Space Station 13 Server
Active build for Dab13 codebase, what is dab13?
Dab13 is a space station 13 server, which tries to aim more to be fun, and not focus that much on the roleplay, can be considered a LRP game. It includes TTS, water simulation, height simulation (jumping!), "robust guns" as the players call it, sandbox, fun, animations (your spacemans are now dancing), particle system, etc. Read more about it in https://github.com/AlcaroIsAFrick/Dab13/tree/master/docs

https://discord.gg/gAuEREJ is our discord.

# I get a lot of errors when compiling mostly about "dmi files"
In dream maker go to build > preferences for dabberstation and tick "automatically set FILE_DIR for sub directories"

# Setup (For server hosts)
Download this repo as a zip. **ADVICE : use github desktop for ability to update at any time**

Compile using Dream Maker (takes usually 20 seconds!) you can also do Compile And Run if you want to do a testrun of how your server's gonna play. If you're gonna do this, make sure the folder with your project is named "dab13" and not "dab13-master" or anything else, it must be dab13 or else Ultra-Safe mode will be enabled.

Use dream daemon to host, Don't use port 9999 or 0, because it enables local testing mode and makes a few debugging stuff enabled.

You need to edit ADMIN_REWORK.dm to change admins. And you need to create a webhook.txt file and webhookAdmin.txt file in the config folder, These are used for the discord webhooks. webhook.txt is a webhook that logs player chat, and webhookAdmin.txt is a adminhelp webhook.

Gamemodes cannot be configured yet. I plan to add configuration for it soon.

# Admin Tools / Commands
Admin tools aren't that big. But you may suggest new ones to me. Currently we have main admin features like banning, kicking, sounds, teleporting. etc
